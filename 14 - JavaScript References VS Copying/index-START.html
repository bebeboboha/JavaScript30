    console.log(players,team)
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Peggy'

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players,team)
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    console.log(players,team2)
    team2[3] = 'woooo'
    console.log(players,team2)
    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(players,team3)
    team3[3] = 'woooo'
    console.log(players,team3)
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    console.log(players,team4)
    team4[3] = 'woooo'
    console.log(players,team4)

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    console.log(players,team5)
    team5[3] = 'woooo'
    console.log(players,team5)
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
        name:'peggy',
        age:22
    }
    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const p2 = Object.assign({},person,{number:100,age:100})
    console.log(p2)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
